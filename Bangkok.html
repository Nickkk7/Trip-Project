Bangkok or Krung Thep, “City of Angels“, is like our home away from home. We simply love this vibrant and urban big city with all its life, delicious street food, green and lush parks, a network of rivers, amazing shopping, some of the biggest markets in the world, and of course, its friendly people.<br>
Bangkok Grand Palace used to be where the whole country was run by the King and his court over the period of 150 years, through 10 kings. The palace represents the peak of Thai architecture with its magnificence and brilliance, which is one of the main reasons why it still attracts millions of visitors from around the world. This guide will help you prepare all you need to know when you want to see this golden palace.<br>
During his reign, King Phutthaloetla Naphalai (Rama II) expanded the palace southwards, increasing its total area from 213,674 square meters (2,299,970 sq ft) to 218,400 square meters (2,351,000 sq ft). Throughout history, there were numerous additions to the palace such as Dusit Palace and Phaya Thai Palace. The end of Thai absolute monarchy took place in 1932 when a revolution eliminated the old system of government in favor of a constitutional monarchy, similar to the UK.<br>
The palace is open all year round, except recently closing in October 2017 in preparation for the royal cremation ceremonies of the late king Bhumibol Adulyadej. Opening times are from 8:30 to 15:30. Ticket inside the palace costs around 500 baht (16 USD) for foreigners and is free for Thai citizens.
