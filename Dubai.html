Burj Khalifa is a megatall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the building is best known for being the current world's tallest skyscraper, it's the most popular tourist attraction in Dubai <br>
Burj Khalifa, literally means Khalifa Tower. Formerly known as Burj Dubai or Dubai Tower, which was changed to Burj Khalifa when the tower officially opened on January 4th 2010. Khalifa is derived from the name of Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Maktoum, who is the president of Adu Dhabi as well as United Arab Emirates, Burj Khalifa and other construction projects in Dubai were once on the verge of halting due to the attack of Financial Crisis, it was neighbor Adu Dhabi provided funds to Dubai in the hard time, this is the main reason for Dubai to rename the tower Burj Khalifa, additionally the word Khalifa has a important significance in Islam, it means Islamic world's supreme leader.<br>
The architectural height of Burj Khalifa is 828 meters or 2717 feet, this is measured to the top of the spire, as its spire is considered an architectural element of the tower.
Before 2010, Burj Khalifa's height has long been kept as a secret in order to prevent it from being surpassed by potential competitors. Finally the owner Emaar claimed the standard height of Burj Khalifa to be 828 meters, with a total height of 829.8 meters to its tip (there's a 1.7 meter small needle atop the top of spire at 828 meters), making it the tallest building in the world in any categories. As of 2019, Burj Khalifa has been holding the crown of World's Tallest Building for 10 years, it will keep the crown for another 3 to 5 years, until in 2022 or later when either the Dubai Creek Tower or Jeddah Tower surpasses it.
