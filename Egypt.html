            <p>One of the ancient mysteries that’s captured the hearts of people all over the world and is on many people’s bucket list is visiting the Pyramids of Giza.

How old are the Pyramids, really? How did the Pyramids get there? Why are the Pyramids there? All of these questions are asked even before you’ve set foot in Egypt and probably came from flicking through the pages of your classroom text books.

The fact that we can stand and witness the remaining legacy of an ancient civilisation blows my mind. There is such beauty in the art of time travel, getting lost in the wonder, allowing it to take your breath away and….suddenly, you wake up and realise your in modern day Giza!

Giza is like beautiful chaos. A trade off between the most fantastic views of the Pyramids and the hustle and bustle of the mass tourism industry here.

Like it or not, you’ll be hassled. For taxis, camel rides, tours, souvenirs, you name it – it’s here and people want you to buy.

Having been to Giza around five or so times on my travels in Egypt, I became hardened to it, know my way around a little bit and have some tricks up my sleeve for you.

Here’s a guide of how to survive visiting the Pyramids of Giza and top tips to keep in mind.</p>
                
                
                

 <p>You will need a Visa for Egypt. These can be bought on the border at Immigration for $25USD or beforehand online for the same price. I’ve created a detailed guide of how to get an Egyptian Visa (including a Multiple entry Visa) for UK citizens here. But it applies for most countries. 
Don’t forget travel insurance for Egypt, it’s quite easy to get ill here! I always choose World Nomad’s as they have great policies at a competitive price.
Egypt is a predominantly Islamic country which means it’s conservative and you will need to be mindful of how you dress, even men. I’ve created a detailed packing list for women here.
Egypt uses the Egyptian Pound as currency and I found it easier to get some out at the ATM. Cards are accepted in most hotels but I’d use cash for shopping and attractions.</p>
